Final Project Proposal: XR Arcade

Zombie Paintball - They feel no fear, why should you?
Alex Burch

Project Description
My inspiration for this project comes off a classic arcade/amusement park game and event which is paintball shooting. Typically, targets pop up, move in horizontal and vertical lines at various speeds, and the target of the game is to shoot them down with your paintball gun, resulting in an increasing score per target shot down. This is something that I’ve done multiple times at various arcades/places such as Anderson Farms and is super fun. Keeping with the fall theme, I intend to make mine a zombie theme with various spooky design elements, music, and meshes to keep with the spooky, arcade theme. 

Feature Breakdown
In this section please fill out a table or list of the features you plan to implement for this project and how challenging you view them to be for you (on a scale of 1 to 5). Here is an example of the format I am looking for:

Zombie movement: Zombie heads move at various speeds in various directions
    Estimated Challenge - 3/4: This will be interesting to implement but I think with the use of precise spline movement, this can be accomplished

Shooting them down: Once shot, the zombie heads “fall back”, and a score is attributed to the shot
    Estimated Challenge - 4: Would need to animate the movement of the head going back, would need to keep a counter of the score for every time the zombie is hit, and would need to keep the collision box accurate with movement so that it properly tracks a successful shot

Time: A time clock is attributed to the game, meaning players only have a certain time to shoot the zombies making the scoring competitive.
    Estimated Challenge - 4: This one will be tough because I would need to assign time reduction as a global variable. Ideally, each level is a scene but upon scene transition, the clock timer needs to keep going down and not reset.

Stretch goal #1 UI: A start scene featuring a cool UI design, where users enter a username; this tracks the user’s score and compares it to other users, which all scores and users are shown in a leaderboard.
    Estimated Challenge - 4/5: This one will be a stretch goal cause I think I can create a stable, cool game without this extensive of a UI system/menu. 
    
Stretch goal #2 Different guns: Users can employ various guns to complete the timer. Each gun would implement a different time limit to ensure fair competitiveness. 
    Estimated Challenge - 4/5: This one will also be a stretch goal cause it won’t be necessary for the base game. But employing different guns like a shotgun with a spread shot and a rifle where you can hold down the trigger and it shoots full auto would be really cool.

Milestones
List here the progress you intend to make by each milestone check point. The dates I have represented here are actual due dates for project submissions. These will also be in class time to get feedback from me and other students, so you must have something ready to test by class on each of these days.
By 11/19 - Implement a working gun, a working environment, working zombie heads with proper movement and animation, and a score counter.
By 12/5  - Implement time, continuation of score counter/scene transitions, and working on overall design such a environment, mesh, music, asset packs, overall completion of base game, and stretch goals if any free time.
